# ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Prediction using Python, MySQL & Machine Learning
This project focuses on predicting customer churn through in-depth data analysis and machine learning techniques. It is designed to assist businesses in identifying at-risk customers and improving decision-making using actionable insights.

ðŸš€ Key Features
ðŸ”— Python-MySQL Integration
Established a seamless connection between Python and MySQL to extract, analyze, and visualize data. Utilized SQL (basic to advanced queries) for deriving valuable business insights.

ðŸ“ˆ Data Visualization
Created intuitive graphs, charts, and tables using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to better understand churn patterns and customer behavior.

ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Models
Leveraged Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation. Applied:

Multiple classification algorithms

Cross-validation techniques

Hyperparameter tuning

The Support Vector Classifier (SVC) achieved the best performance in predicting churn with optimized parameters.

ðŸ“Œ Business Impact
The project supports proactive customer retention strategies by identifying high-risk customers based on historical behavior and data trends.
