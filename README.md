# Customer-Churn-Analysis-Project-
This project focuses on predicting customer churn through data analysis and machine learning. I began by performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python to understand the dataset and identify key patterns. SQL was used to extract valuable business insights directly from the data. Visualizations were created with Matplotlib and Seaborn to highlight important trends and relationships. For predictive modeling, I used Scikit-learn to train and evaluate multiple algorithms. Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning were applied to optimize performance, with Support Vector Classifier (SVC) emerging as the best-performing model.
